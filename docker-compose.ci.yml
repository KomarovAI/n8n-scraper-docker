# CI Override Configuration
# This file is composed with docker-compose.yml in CI to force usage of built image
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ci.yml up

services:
  n8n:
    # Override image to use locally built n8n-enhanced:test in CI
    # This ensures CI uses the image built by workflow (with custom scripts)
    # instead of pulling n8nio/n8n:latest from Docker Hub
    image: n8n-enhanced:test
    
    # All other settings inherited from docker-compose.yml
